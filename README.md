# Introduction

Euclid is a header only library for geometry processing and shape analysis.

It contains some functions and algorithms which extend and cooperate with other popular libraries around there, like Eigen(libigl), CGAL, OpenCV, to name a few.

# Dependencies

You'll need the following libraries when you use headers in Euclid that deal with them,
- CGAL
- Eigen
- OpenCV

# Installation

Just include the needed headers.

# License

MIT for code not related to any third-party libraries.

Otherwise it should follow whatever license the third-party libraries require, I guess?
