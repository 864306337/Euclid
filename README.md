# Introduction

Euclid is a header only library for geometry processing and shape analysis.

It contains some functions and algorithms which extend and cooperate with other major libraries in the literature, like CGAL, Eigen(libigl), OpenCV, to name a few.

# Dependencies

The following packages are optional if you do not use the part of Euclid working with these libraries:
- CGAL
- Eigen
- OpenCV

# Installation

Just include the needed headers.

# License

MIT for code not related to any third-party libraries.

Otherwise it should follow whatever license the third-party libraries require, I guess?
